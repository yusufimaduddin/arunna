Arunna is initially a CMS project that wishes to be developed to assist the web designer and web developer in developing application as for faster and efficient.

In the course of its development, an idea to add some new features was emerged that eventually Arunna is not only for CMS, but also can be used as social media with client, staff or your friends. A change of behaviour on internet which was primarily "searching" becomes "questioning" is one of our triggers to create Arunna. In this case the most important thing is you decide with whom you are going to share and what you are going to share.

All information including friends profile, photos, messages, status or article shall be your own property since Arunna is an opensource.
